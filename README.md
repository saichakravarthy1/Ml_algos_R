# Ml_algos_R

This code in R takes a dataset URL and properties from the command line and analyzes it using various classifiers.

Below is the list of the classifiers that were implemented in this Script:

1. Decision Tree
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Na√Øve Bayesian
4. kNN
5. Logistic Regression
6. Neural Network
7. Bagging
8. Random Forest
9. Boosting

The following are the datasets that are being used:
1. Credit default dataset that is available at:
